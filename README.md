# BOTW-Finder
### Find any creature or material from Zelda a Breath of the Wild.

This site was made for a final project of BYU Idahos's CSE121b class.

### How it Works
A user searches for a creature or material from Zelda a Breath of the Wild and BOTW Finder calls the Hyrule Compendium API and returns the creature or material the user searched for, its image and its location.
